            <h2>Understanding TV Energy Ratings in Australia</h2>
            <p>Australia's energy rating system for televisions provides consumers with important information about the energy efficiency of different models. The data collected includes various metrics that help determine a television's star rating.</p>
            
            <div class="metrics-grid">
                <div class="metric-card">
                    <h3>Screen Technology</h3>
                    <p>The type of screen technology (LCD, Plasma, OLED, etc.) significantly impacts energy consumption. Newer technologies like LED-backlit LCDs are generally more efficient than older plasma screens.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="metric-card">
                    <h3>Screen Size & Area</h3>
                    <p>Measured diagonally in centimeters, screen size directly affects energy use. Larger screens consume more power, which is why energy ratings consider both screen size and area (height × width).</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="metric-card">
                    <h3>Standby Power Modes</h3>
                    <p>Modern TVs have two standby modes:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Passive Standby:</strong> Low-power state for receiving remote signals</li>
                            <li><strong>Active Standby:</strong> Higher-power state for network connectivity and updates</li>

                    <h3>Average On-Mode Power</h3>
                    <p>This measurement indicates the energy consumed when the television is actively displaying content. It's the primary factor in determining energy efficiency during use.</p>

                <div class="metric-card">
                    <h3>Comparative Energy Consumption (CEC)</h3>
                    <p>Expressed as kilowatt-hours per year, the CEC provides an estimate of annual energy use based on typical viewing patterns, allowing for easy comparison between models.</p>

                    <p>The star rating (ranging from 1 to 10 stars) indicates relative efficiency within a product category. More stars mean better energy efficiency and lower operating costs.</p>
